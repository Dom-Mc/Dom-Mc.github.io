Our [first significant project](https://github.com/Dom-Mc/get_seo) at [Flatiron](https://flatironschool.com/) was “supposed” to be fairly straight forward. Create a basic CLI Ruby program, scrape a website by using the popular Nokogiri gem, parse the data, and display results to the user. Upon completion we were also required to package our program as a Ruby gem, nothing overly complicated. Unless of course for some strange reason you decided to make it overly complicated, however who would be foolish enough to do something like that (a hand is reluctantly raised).

It was soooooo simple, easy, almost effortless, these are all adjectives I was really hoping to use often in this blog post. Oh well. In reality the project was painfully frustrating. My first two concepts flamed out due to an issue with scraping dynamically created content. In retrospect it makes sense how content created via javascript could present a challenge to scrape. Unfortunately searching for a solution ended up being more time consuming than I could afford. My next idea involved targeting larger sites but apparently not all websites appreciate their information being scraped by visitors. Go figure.

Finally after many (failed) attempts I stumbled upon an idea with legs. I decided to create a simple gem to retrieve SEO related information. Having some SEO experience underneath my belt, I knew what items to target and was able to write a program fairly quickly. I *of course* ran a few final manual tests to verify everything worked as expected. The only thing left on the todo list was to record a quick demo. The finish line was finally within sight but then it happened. In what should have been concluded with a simple `exit` command, ended up being `exit… WTF#&@^$#%@$&%#@^!?!` And now 48 hours later I can finally say I’m done. Happy? No. Satisfied? Nope. I've finished the project and that’s all I have left to say.

Welcome to programming, noobie.
