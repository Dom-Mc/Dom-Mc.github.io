Life is ultimately unpredictable and so was my journey into the world programming. I was introduced through building static websites and slowly the more I learned, the more I loved to code. The evolving tools, the concept of open source software, plus communities who donate their time to help out complete strangers, I had never seen anything like it before.

I ultimately decided to make a career switch and enrolled at a local junior college with the goal of eventually obtaining a CS degree. I was extremely excited about the decision, however that excitement was short lived.  After only several weeks in, it quickly became apparent, there’s one gigantic gap between our educational system and the tech world. The abundance of state-of-the-art resources readily available on the web can feel almost overwhelming at times. To have been exposed to those learning tools and all of the sudden be using applications plucked from the mid 2000’s (so it seemed) was quite disheartening to say the least. In addition, I went from coding 7 days a week, to identifying a keyboard for a homework assignment (yes it really happened) and crafting Wikipedia posts. So I cut my losses and decided to continue learning on my own and enroll in a coding bootcamp when the time was right.

I started with HTML, CSS-SASS, and the basics of JavaScript-jQuery.  After that I began to slowly venture out to PHP, SQL, and frameworks such as Laravel.  My curiosities eventually lead me to both Ruby & Rails and I’ve been hooked ever since.

After researching various bootcamp options, in May I was accepted at learn.co (Flatiron) and have been learning ever since. Fast forward 7 months, I’m currently a day away from finishing and I simply cannot wait.  It’s been an up and down journey to say the least, however making the decision/commitment to enroll was one of the best decisions I’ve ever made.  With the end of one chapter in sight, another soon awaits.
